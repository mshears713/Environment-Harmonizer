# Project dependencies
# Some of these may not be installed, demonstrating missing dependency detection

# Standard library - always available
# (no external packages needed for basic example)

# For a real test with missing packages, uncomment these:
# requests>=2.28.0
# click>=8.0.0
# colorama>=0.4.6

# Note: To avoid actually requiring external packages in examples,
# the harmonizer will detect if requirements.txt exists but is minimal
