# Environment Harmonizer - Core Dependencies
#
# This project uses primarily standard library modules to minimize external dependencies
# and improve portability across different environments.
#
# All core functionality is built using Python 3.7+ standard library:
# - argparse: CLI argument parsing
# - pathlib: Filesystem path handling
# - json: Configuration and report serialization
# - platform: OS and system detection
# - subprocess: External command execution
# - dataclasses: Structured data modeling

# Optional: Enhanced terminal output (uncomment if needed)
# colorama>=0.4.6
